# One-page and technical SEO cheat sheet for 2020

**Don't be afraid of the ‘technical’ in the title, here's a cheat sheet with things to look for and links to tools that don’t require coding.**

## Technical

**If Google can’t reach somewhere, that thing won’t be ranked at all! So it's all about making it easier for Google.**

 - For starters use https://builtwith.com/ and https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse to gain an overview of your site
 - Use https://www.drlinkcheck.com/ or https://ipullrank.com/tools/map-broker/ to find broken links amd fix them ASAP
 - In my experience JS is the hot potato right now, that’s why you should use  https://www.onely.com/tools/wwjd/ to find out what your site would look like without JS - means, to find places where Google may not reach
 - Use Coverage Report and Inspect URL from Google Search Console to find out what Google sees and what not 
 - Use https://www.onely.com/tools/tldr/ or https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ or https://gtmetrix.com/ to check if your site is fast nuff for Google
 - Use https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly to find out if you won’t be downranked because your site isn’t mobile friendly
 - Include your keyword in URL, but keep URL short

## Keywords

**Plan your keyword strategy using those tools.**

 - Use https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/ and https://keywordtool.io/ to look for keywords
 - Use https://answerthepublic.com/ for Question & Answer keywords
 - Use Google suggest, Google Searches related to... , Google Autocomplete and Google People also ask for suggestions directly from Google
 - Don't over-use your keyword. Instead of repeating one keyword 1000x, choose 3-4-5 keywords that you will repeat several times
 - Use https://lsigraph.com/ to find alternatives for overusing your keywords. Stick to LSI Keywords; for Google these are like synonyms for you
 - Use your target keywords within 100 first words – old one, but still works
 - Instead of avoiding long-tail keywords, be smart about them. Why? because long tail keywords aren’t that competitive – use them for your advantage

## Structure

**Structure is as important as your Keyword strategy. Use this list and you won't forget anything.**

 - Use H1, H2, H3 formatting to help Google understand structure of your site
 - Use your Keywords in H1, H2, H3 titles
 - Use modifiers for your H1, H2, H3 title tag's
 - Use keywords while naming your images
 - Use 'alt tags' attributes with your images

## Links

**Links are still relevant. Don't miss these few tips on what to look for while working with them.**

 - Use outbound links in your text to help Google understand what it is about
 - Try to use authority sites like Wikipedia (yeah… I know), MIT whitepapers, Google own dev blogs etc
 - Use internal links to related content
 - While naming your links use anchor text that contains authority site names, author name or describe it with keywords
